[Tom to review and confirm]

​​Search intelligence: To confirm for the implementation of Regex via any of the below options:
1) To use Synonyms i.e. to ingest regex data for all products as synonyms in magento
2) To get all Regex combinations for products in an additional meta data field to be imported via SCR, magento will import field data of that additional field and make it searchable to get search results based on that field data.


​[Clarifications provided by Tom/Azham:]

​SAP Error message when there is an error from Magento e.g. Ecom API token gets expired in magento:
	   [Tom/Azham: Pick any random unique number (different from provide SAP error codes) for distinguishing magento error and inform SAP/Customer Service Team]
​Exclude Promo code call from Ecom API OrderVerify call on 'Review Order' in checkout, to avoid discrepancy with Item price and basket total. As per discussion with Balel: The item price gets changed via OrderVerify Ecom API call as per provided Promo code discount codes which will in turn affect the Basket Total amount due to Discount already applied in magento.
