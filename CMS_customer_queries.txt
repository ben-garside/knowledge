07 Feb 2018:
	- To keep hyperlink on Bluefoot media -> Hyperlink (call to action), Images are coming broken
	- To disable to 'Delete Page' for Marketting Team (keep it for 'Marketting Admin)
	- Remove permission for main hierarchy section and keep under cms page
	- CMS Page -> Hierarchy selection needs to be mandatory
	- Create 2 urls like shortcut url (eg: bitly or google shortener)
		CM01 - AC7 -> Redirect to 2 different urls for same page
	- Add robots.txt setting to CMS Page:
			Hint: For insance, in the admin, go to a CMS Page. Then go to the design tab, in the layout updates add this:
				<head>
					<meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW"/>
				</head>
	- Show warning before deleting an image or changing anything in a hierarchy
		- When delete the image, it should show what all pages it has been used
	- Delete block => Show WARNING (as it might be included on many pages)
	- Redirect to external url from Marketting -> Url Rewrite section
	- Bluefoot -> textarea -> Add link -> sometimes the anchor/link icon is showing disabled => appearing randomly
	- Sector Pages => as Product page and marketting team will create a CMS page and keep a URL in Sector product page
	- * (Sridhar) Send a manual for creating RELATED PRODUCTS
	
				
31/01:
	To set hierarchy in Blocks (Berengerie)

22/01:

Need to Raise with Magento after discussion with Azham/Uma:
- * BLUEFOOT -> MEDIA:  Resizing images -> cut/proportion 
- * View only permission: eg for hierarchy so that users may not change -> raise a ticket to magento
- To confirm with AZHAM: 2 urls for cms pages (promotional urls), Also check with Richa for AC for this
- To show current page hierarchy from Bluefoot -> textarea when linking to a url
- ** BLUEFOOT: TO UPLOAD IMAGES/PDFs (from rich text editor - working in Magento CMS but not in BLUEFOOT)
	[Also bluefoot maintains files in separate folder - gene-cms i.e. NOT SHOWING INSIDE MEDIA SECTION IN ANY FOLDER]
- * Show Warning message -> when a page is removed from Page hierarchy [Check with Magento Cloud] --> Change Request (as not present in ACs)
- Versions of CMS Pages
- Adding Blocks/Banners on Product Details Page ....is it feasible in Magento?  --- to check self (put block beneath Buy Now button)


To check:
	- How url rewrite will work for products. Also to add external url in url_rewrite
	- Permission: To show only Shop Editors to Pricilla

IMP POINTS:
** CONSOLIDATE ALL CMS ISSUES BEFORE SENDING TO MAGENTO CLOUD -> FOR Bluefoot
** BSI Gesta Font
** What dimensions of images to upload

----------- Demo Happened  on 09 Jan 2018 --------------------------------------

Queries from CMS team:

-> EDIT from frontend
-> url_key => put ../pas3001  -> shud redirect to url_key (eg: /pid-243243434)  --> eg: from htaccess

-> Editing images in Bluefoot
-> Remove hierarchy permission from backend


-> robots.txt setting (allow in shop editor role)
=========================
page navigation


how to exclude sub menu from hide by default from hierarchy => check from page as well

Recover deleted page

---------------
Hi Support Team,

Please confirm about the below CMS functions in official Bluefoot CMS release. Also, please let us know the official launch date of Bluefoot (as we need to inform our customer)?

1) Image cannot be directly added to a block via Bluefoot, the only option is add it via image url
2) Resize of media files using Bluefoot (to change the size of the image within the page), it is there in default magento currently
3) Unable to upload PDFs with bluefoot
4) Bluefoot feature for Catalog pages (showing in bluefoot demo but not present with Magento 2.1.8)
5) We can't hyperlink images using bluefoot media feature
6) Hierarchy Feature for Blocks: Need to have a way to organize block in folders or groupings, in order to have a better order of them, and to be able to find them (there will be plenty created in the long run)
7) Standard warning should be shown before deleting any file/folder
8) Recycle bin for files: Deleted file should not be permanently deleted. It should go to some temp folder and we should be able to recover (i.e from the rubbish bin)
9) Editors should not be allowed to move the items in the hierarchy
Hyperlink Icon looks disabled though its not disabled. It works. But why the icon looks disabled
10) SEO and Robots in the same place (when creating a page)

Thanks,
Saurabh
